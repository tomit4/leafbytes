        <h2>A personal blog on learning to code</h2>
        <p id="intro">Welcome to leafbytes!<br>
        For the love of all that is decent, how did you find me!!?<br>
        <br>
        You have somehow managed to stumble on my obscure little corner of the web.
        <br>A dark and secluded place where I document my meanderings through attempts to learn about linux, coding/programming, and technology in general.
        <br>Beware, ye who continue from here on out, for this nightmarish site includes some of the worst code snippets you have ever laid eyes on.
        <br>
        <br>Upon gazing on my own code, I often turn to stone, my mouth agape in horror at my own creations, only to inexplicably awaken the next day to repeat the same horrific mistakes again and again, like Sisyphus rolling the boulder up a hill for eternity...
        <br>
        <br>
        Indeed wary traveler of this here intranets, you have stumbled on no mere beginner's website. I implore you to turn back now before it is too late...
        <br>
        <br>
        For those of you too foolish, I can only wish you good luck as you behold my horrific creations.
        </p>
        <p id="intro">This is just a sample code snippet:</p>
        <div class="snippet">
        <pre><code>var foo = "bar";
var hello = "world";
console.log(foo);
console.log(hello);</code></pre>
