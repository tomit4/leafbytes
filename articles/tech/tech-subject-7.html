        <h4 class="article-header4">Introduction</h4>
        <p class="article-content">This particular blog post is much more an opinion piece than my previous posts
on this site. I must admit that upon investigation of the topic of systemd, I did
not realize how extensive the rabbit hole I had decided to dive down into was. After
emerging from my research, which involved combing over a multitude of
videos presentations, wikipedia articles, blog posts, one extremely lengthy
email exchange, and thousands of lines of C code, I must admit I am still at a loss
on what to make of it all.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">When I first came to utilize Linux and interact with its community, I was
very intrigued by this "init war" that had started nearly a decade earlier.
While one can find various reddit posts covering the essentials
of this conflict, with a wide swath of opinions regarding systemd and its pros and
cons, I ultimately found that many of these summaries to be dissatisfactory.
Unlike other debates within the Linux ecosystem, which could occassionally get heated,
disagreements over systemd were always more fierce and vitriolic than the rest.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that the "init wars" emerged from differing opinions not only of technical
implementation of the init process, but also differing opinions on how software
engineering should be approached in general. Additionally, sociological and  ethical questions arose around
the subject of systemd, as its founder's approach to the promotion and
implementation of systemd led to accusations of him and his methodologies being
antithetical to the UNIX philosophy. Opposing this viewpoint were those who would praise systemd's founder for implementing a more modern approach to softare on Linux, which emphasized a more fully featured set of
 integrated tools with a more user-friendly command line interface.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
This article is meant to present the reader with an overview and
summary of the history behind systemd and its context within the Linux ecosystem
at large. I have done my best to figure out exactly what happened, but
ultimately I will probably fail to cover the events in their entirety.
It has been painful researching this topic, as ultimately, the story of systemd and
the "init wars" is somewhat tragic. It is my opinion that this conflict over systemd
was unnecessarily amplified by its founders, who pushed forward
their software and philosophy in a manner that could easily be described as
aggressive and dismissive towards their detractors. These detractors also unnecessarily
escalated the conflict surrounding this debate, as is evidenced in multiple
threads on forums and email exchanges on the topic of systemd adoption, in which
vitriolic flame wars were started, oftentimes with little technical merit to
their effusive expressions of outright hatred for the software, its founder, and
the company from which it originated.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
While many within the Linux ecosystem today are happy to simply use their respective
Linux distributions and give little thought to the subject of init, there remain a few
within the Linux ecosystem who are still very much opposed to using systemd
and are very critical of the technical skills and ethical integrity of its
founders. This conflict left many in the Linux ecosystem dejected, disparaged,
and disheartened. It is due to the tragic nature of these events that I feel that this
subject is worth giving more time to cover in detail than others who cover the subject of
Linux seem to be willing to give it. So let's take a deep dive into this subject, and take
a closer look at what's init.
        </p>
        <h4 class="article-header4">In The Beginning, There Was Init</h4>
        <p class="article-content">
In a previous article, I made the argument as to Why You Should Use Linux. Towards the end of it, I walked you through the basics of installing Linux Mint, and through it you hopefully gained some basic understanding of how Linux is installed on The Desktop. If you were particularly astute during the process, you will have learned a little bit about the BIOS and the bootloader, GRUB. I also introduced the concept of the Kernel in that article, where I attempted to give you a very bare bones explanation of what the Kernel is.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
Now, once GRUB has launched the Linux kernel, a series of messages is usually
displayed, indicating that the Kernel has found the init system daemon, and this
is the process that then starts the rest of your Operating System, eventually
bringing you to a shell or a login screen. So what is this init system? I'll
refer you to the <a class="article-outside-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init">Wikipedia Article</a> for a more
in-depth summary, but very simply, the init system is the first process that runs
on your computer after the bootloader has loaded the Kernel. If the Kernel doesn't
find this init process, a Kernel Panic ensues, which is a safety measure indicating
a fatal error has been encountered, and you are unable to boot.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
If, however, the init program is found, then the Kernel launches this process. Technically this process can be any program, but the init system's main job is to create other processes (start other programs). A process is always given an ID by the Operating System known as a PID. This is done in order to easily keep track of all running processes, with the init process always being assigned to PID 1. The init system should, in theory, be a relatively simple program as it mainly has to do with initializing other processes through a system call known as a fork.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
Additionally, the init system also is generally assigned the task of "adopting"
"orphaned" processes. This means that should any process die, but not completely
shut down, the init system will take over the process and attempt to kill
(terminate) that process rather than allow it to continue to run in the
background, unnecessarily consuming computing resources. This process is known as
"reparenting."
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
Lastly, since the early System V implementation of init, init has been responsible
for cleanly executing the reboot and shutdown process.
        </p>
        <h4 class="article-header4">The Early Inits</h4>
        <p class="article-content">
When a Research Release of UNIX had become popular amongst students and faculty at The University of California Berkley in 1975, developers introduced a BSD-style init system that included the use of shell scripts, which were launched from the /etc/rc file. The advantages of this were that the init scripts were highly customizable and configurable, but with the disadvantage that any change to these scripts could result in an unbootable system.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
With the arrival of UNIX System III in 1983, a new init system known as System-V
init, or sysv-init, was introduced which utilized modes of operation known as run-levels. Run-levels helped define the different states the computer was in after the boot process completed. These runlevels were implemented across different UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, with the common factor being that the runlevels were defined in the /etc/inittab file. While System V helped differentiate the init process and its various responsibilities into well defined modules, a small syntax error made to the /etc/inittab file could easily result in an unbootable system (very much like BSD's init). Nevertheless, System V remained the default init system in many UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems until the early 2000s, when alternatives were being called for as the responsibilities of computers were becoming more diverse, and the problems inherent in the design of System V were becoming more apparent.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
The issue with System-V Style Init that many of these later implementations of init tried to
address was the issue of serial execution of the initial processes. Each process
was bound by Input/Ouput blocking, which essentially means that each process had
to wait for the previous process to end before another process could begin. As
more and more processes began to become necessary to launch when the Operating
System started up, the time for the init system to start all of these
processes began to become exorbitantly long. The parallelization of processes
(starting the series of processes in parallel utilized by waiting for the
 availability of the process's file descriptor), had long been a present feature in networking
implementations of the time, and was being actively developed for the init
process by many within both the Closed Source and Open Source Communities. This
resulted in a plethora of init systems coming onto the scene in the early 2000s.
For BSD and Linux there was Openrc, runit, Upstart. Each of these init systems addressed the problem of process parallalelization as well as other issues within System-V Style Init, with Upstart gaining the most momentum and thusly, attention. Indeed, due to the backing of Canonical, and Upstart's early adoption by many Linux distributions, it appeared that a true successor to System-V init had been found... but this succession never came to be.
        </p>
        <h4 class="article-header4">An Upstart Init</h4>
        <p class="article-content">
As mentioned previously, the early 2000s saw the birth of a series of modern
init system programs designed to replace System-V and BSD-style init. This was
due to the increasing need for parallelization of processes and an efficient way
of restarting processes should they fail. Many of the early programs that
addressed these issues were based around the <a class="article-outside-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemontools">daemontools</a> processes supervision
toolkit written by American German mathematician, cryptologist, and computer
scientist, <a class="article-outside-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Bernstein">Daniel Bernstein</a>.
Released in 2001, daemontools offered an
alternative to system initialization as well as a series of process supervision
tools. The features that daemontools included were easy installation/removal,
easy first-time service startup, reliable restarts, reliable signalling,
clean process state, and portability. Bernstein's daemontools and other
notable programs inspired other modern init systems like Laurent Bercot's s6
init, and Gerrit Pape's much more minimalist init system, runit. These init
systems addressed many of the concerns that were being raised about System V
init. Perhaps unfotunately, however, these init systems never received much
attention by the mainstream Linux community at the time of their release.
This was probably due to the lack of required manpower needed to write the
vast amount of scripts that were necessary for them to gain popularity. If
System V init was to be replaced, it would need more momentum behind it. The
original push towards a mainstream contender to System V Init came from a
relative newcomer to the Linux Ecosystem, a UK software company called
Canonical <a class="article-outside-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_(company)">Canonical</a>, and their now
ubiquitously known Linux Distribution, <a class="article-outside-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)">Ubuntu</a>.
</p>
<p class="article-content">
Canonical's Ubuntu Linux, a very popular Linux distribution founded in 2004,
converted their default init system over to their own in-house developed
init, Upstart, in 2006. Upstart's init, unlike sys-v init, was based around an
event-driven model. This meant that instead of pre-defining certain events prior
to initialization, Upstart was able to respond to events asynchronously as they
occurred. Examples of such events include the adding or removal of USB flash
drives, discovery and scanning of new storage devices, and the loading of
firmware for such devices. This was a marked improvement over sys-v init's synchronous event model, which inherently blocked such tasks from occurring until other pre-defined tasks had first been completed.
</p>
<p class="article-content">
Additionally, unlike runit or s6, Upstart had the backing of the company,
Canonical, which provided Upstart creator, Scott James Remnant, with the
resources to develop the necessary interoperability layer scripts for popular services. For a while, it appeared that System V init's successor would be Upstart. Red Hat's upstream distribution, Fedora Linux, would adopt Upstart in their version 9 release in 2008, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux itself would also adopt Upstart in 2011. It was within Red Hat's team, however, that a German developer Lennart Poettering would come to develop his own init system as an alternative to Upstart. Poettering called this new init offering "systemd".
        </p>
        <h4 class="article-header4">Poettering</h4>
        <p class="article-content">
Lennart Poettering is one of the most well known developers in the Linux
ecosystem. Creator of the ubiquitous PulseAudio sound server (as well as the
Avahi networking software), Lennart was already well known within Linux circles
by 2010, when he debuted his initial release of systemd.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
Lennart had become famous for having controversial technical and architectural
positions in the world of The Linux ecosystem. His speaking style is
particularly adverserial when addressing critics of his software suites. This is
evidenced and confirmed by many who have participated in email exchanges with
Lennart, and has been documented in his interactions with his interactions with
detractors of his software on <a class="article-outside-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer"
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTdUmlGxVo0.">video</a>.
I think it is safe to say that he is brash and unabashedly frank in his expression
of his opinions.
</p>
<p class="article-content">
His technical choices have been highly criticized by a variety of developers,
with particularly vitriolic criticism coming from s6 developer, Laurent
Bercot, as evidenced by this <a class="article-outside-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer" href="https://skarnet.org/lists/supervision/0422.html">email exchange</a>,
and this <a class="article-outside-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer" href="https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-994548-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-25.html#7581522">post on the Gentoo forums</a>
Even Linux founder, Linus Torvaulds, has questioned and criticized
Lennart's design choices within systemd and his cofounder, <a class="article-outside-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lkml.iu.edu//hypermail/linux/kernel/1404.0/01331.html">Kay Siever's handling of bug reports on systemd</a>.
</p>
<p class="article-content">
Regardless of this, Lennart Poettering's influence on the Linux ecosystem has
stood the test of time, with systemd having been adopted now in 2022 by the vast
majority of Linux distributions. It is perhaps due to the ubiquitous presence of
his software that criticisms of both him and his software contributions are still
made against him to this day.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
This blog post will mainly focus on the events surrounding the systemd
controversy, so it is important to note that many have also praised Poettering
for his obviously fervent desire to push development of Linux forward at a rapid
pace. Pulse Audio, while initially having a rough start at Ubuntu Linux,
eventually became the standard audio driver on The Linux Desktop for over a
decade. His work on systemd led to the development of other implementations
of essential services on Desktop Linux like dbus, udev, and logind. It is
important to note, however, that the technical merit of these projects, much like systemd,
are also controversial.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
All of Lennart's software offerings (with the exception of perhaps Avahi), have had some degree of criticism, due in part to Lennart's sometimes particularly abrasive responses when questioned about his design decisions. His systemd init suite of software, in particular, broke with the long standing traditions of The UNIX Philosophy that had been held sacred by many within The Linux and BSD communities for over a decade. He has flippantly disregarded the argument that his software should be POSIX compliant (POSIX is a set of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems). Systemd is, as a result, completely incompatible with other UNIX-like operating systems (like the various BSDs).
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
To say that Lennart Poettering is a divisive figure is somewhat of an
understatement. The only individuals within the Linux Space that are as well
known are Linus Torvaulds himself, and Richard Stallman. It is the precedent
that Lennart set with his software, his presentations, his debates, and his
email exchanges that eventually caused so much vitriolic hatred as well as love
for his greatest contribution to The Linux ecosystem, systemd. The controversy
around systemd, however, cannot be distilled down to the general dislike of its
original developer. Indeed, one cannot completely understand the conflicts that
arose after systemd's adoption, without understanding what exactly systemd is,
and what its developers intend it to be (see next article for part 2).
