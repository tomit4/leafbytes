            Learning any new skill can be daunting. Especially for adults, who
            are often reluctant to engage in something that they are not already
            well versed in. Many people make the mistake believing that once
            they have acquired a certain skill, it is simply a matter of keeping
            up to date with the latest trends in that skill, or, worse yet,
            simply rest on the laurels that their journey in learning has been
            completed. That, at least in regards to the skill that they have
            acquired, that there is somehow nothing left to learn or that those
            last few lessons aren't worth learning, those last few skills not
            worth acquiring.

        <p class="article-content">
            Learning to utilize the computer is, in my opinion, even more
            daunting for an adult to learn. The subject of Computers, Computer
            Science, and the many many subjects that are encompassed under the
            umbrella term, 'Computers,' is indeed so vast that it would take a
            person a lifetime to learn one aspect of it. This leaves many who
            are looking to change careers into systems administration, software
            development, data analytics, and, in my case, web development, at a
            bit of a loss as to where to start. Of course, we live in a day and
            age where any question we have, for the most part, can be fielded
            with some degree of authority, by the modern search engine. Simply
            typing into any of the popular search engines the query "how to
            learn" followed by your desired subject will yield a plethora of
            results on how to get started. This is especially true of web
            development, as the desire by many to land a lucrative paying job
            that is not labor intensive (at least, not manually labor
            intensive), is currently held by a vast multitude of people.

            I am a "self taught" web developer. I use quotations around the
            term, as I believe that all forms of education are both "taught" and
            "self taught." In that I mean that while no one learns entirely by
            themselves (even if you invent an entirely new subject, you are
            still taught/informed by previous subjects as an orientation to this
            new subject, but I digress). Conversely, no one is entirely reliant
            on others to integrate new information. That "aha" moment is due to
            your own mind struggling, and then succeeding, in understanding new
            information, which is conveyed to you via another person in the
            world or the physical world itself.

            When one enters the query "How to learn to be a web developer" or
            "How to learn to code" into a modern search engine, one eventually
            finds themselves at Free Code Camp, The Odin Project, and many many
            YouTube tutorials. These are all fine introductions, and are more
            than worth investigating as they provide one with a plethora of
            inforation that is useful to the modern web developer. All that
            said, learning to work with Computers, in my opinion, first starts
            with understanding how to 'speak' to the computer, to communicate
            your desires to the computer in a way that the computer can
            "understand," or interpret. These desires are conveyed to the
            computer by means of input, often through a keyboard or a mouse, and
            the results are usually conveyed back to the user via output, often
            through a visual screen display or audio device.

            Most of the common utilizations of computers these days are visually
            oriented tools presented in graphical user interfaces(GUIs) that are
            meant to be pleasing to the eye, designed and organized to present
            data to the user in a way that is visually appealing. Many of these
            interfaces now take place within a web browser, rather than a stand
            alone program. Increasingly these applications have adopted either a
            mouse or touch based interface, so as to abstract away from the
            utilization of the keyboard as well, or to minimize the amount of
            input necessary from the user that requires the skill of typing. All
            of these abstractions, in my opinion, are beautiful designs and
            cosmetic wrappings over what is the true skeleton of the a program,
            a simple execution of a very large amoun of zeros and ones.

            It is hard for me to imagine what it must have been like developing
            some of the first computers. Computers, originally, were people who
            executed a large amount of computations. A computer, originally, was
            not a thing, it was a person, a profession. The history of the first
            machines that were the ancestors of the modern computer is extremely
            well documented, and I will not go into detail here. The amount of
            work necessary to get even to the modern terminal interface was
            vast, as the original Operating Systems Engineers were adamantly
            trying to get to a point where a user could simply invoke commands
            from a command line prompt, and have the desired results displayed
            back to them in a human readable format.

            There were many contenders in the early days of Operating Systems,
            but long story short, the Unix Programming Interface won out. While
            one could argue that Windows PowerShell is a modern competitor to
            the Unix Shell, it would be a farcical argument (as evidenced by the
            existence of The Windows Subsystem for Linux). If you utilize MacOS
            and type anything into the terminal, you are interfacing with a Unix
            Environment. This is also true of the BSD variants. Linux, while
            technically a Unix Like environment, in the case of working with the
            command line, and its shell, bash, may be considered working within
            a Unix environment in regards to this overview.

        <p class="article-content">
            At this point, you, my dear reader, may be wondering, "so what are
            you getting at?" Simply put, I am arguing that if you wish to learn
            about computers (in any of its many subjects) you should first learn
            to utilize the command line, specifically within a Unix based
            environment. Learning how to use the command line is the entry point
            to programming, and understanding it at a non-trivial level is
            essential if you wish to work within DevOps or Systems
            Administration.

            Many of those already familiar with the world of Computers and its
            multitude of subjects will find this article boring, as the above
            assertion will be more than obvious, but please bare in mind that I
            only started looking into the world of computers a short three years
            ago at the time of this writing, and prior to that was simply a
            Windows "power user," having never even typed a basic "ls" into a
            terminal before. When I finally did start to investigate how
            computers worked, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I took
            to loving the command line, as it had been a point of contention and
            pain for me for a long time prior to this.

        <p class="article-content">
            I had been using Windows when I first attempted to learn how to
            code. Using the standard tools. VS Code and Google Chrome to put
            together a basic BattleShip Game from the instructions in the book,
            Head First JavaScript. I had no understanding of the command line at
            this point, and was working hard solely in understanding the basic
            syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and, of course what was
            happening in the browser. At one point I had become frustrated with
            the interface of Windows in general, and a good friend of mine who
            is a veteran software developer told me that if I wanted a challenge
            to install Arch Linux (wow, what a jump into the deep end). I ended
            up installing the much easier Manjaro Linux, and while I didn't stay
            with that particular distribution of Linux for long, it did
            introduce me to the terminal, and in all honesty, my life changed
            because of it.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            It was only a couple months of using Manjaro Linux that I learned
            the basic commands. "ls" is usually the first command one learns. It
            shows all the files within one's current directory(folder). "cd"
            allows you to change directories. A good example is "cd Documents"
            will navigate your "current directory" from your "home" directory
            into your "Documents directory. "cd .." will navigate you up one
            directory in your directory hiearchy. "touch newfile" will create a
            file called "newfile". "rm oldfile" will delete a file called
            "oldfile." There are many many more commands, but these are the very
            basics to interfacing with your operating system.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            To the uninitiated, this may seem trivial. "So what? I can simply
            hit ta few buttons in my Windows Explorer and do the same thing."
            And you'd be right, but becoming more competent at utilizing the
            command line can greatly increase your productivity in ways that are
            unprecedented to any "power user." Say you're working on a website,
            with alot of similarly titled articles (article-1.html,
            article-2.html, etc.). Let's also say you need to create... one
            hundred of these. I suppose you could just keep clicking on "New
            File" and name them one by one. The uninitiated might say "Yeah,
            it's annoying, but so what? You just type 'touch article-1.html' and
            then 'touch article-2.html', I don't care how fast a typist you are,
            that still takes alot of time." And you'd be right...but the command
            line isn't just an interface, it's a basic programming
            language...and if there's anything computers do really well, it's
            repetitive tasks:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">touch article-{1-100}.html</code></pre>
        <p class="article-content">
            And behold, I have just created 100 files, appropriatetly labeled
            and ready to go on my massive project. Others might say "Yeah,
            that's great, but I'm trying to learn such and such programming
            language, and I only need to know the basics when it comes to the
            command line, why bother getting into the weeds with all this stuff,
            isn't that mainly for SysAdmins and DevOps guys?" Again, you'd be
            right...but I'd argue that the command line, and the shell language
            usually used for it, Bash, is worth learning. The command line is
            not just an interface, but also a great introduction to computer
            programming.
        </p>
        <!-- cover brief history of bash here -->
        <p class="article-content">What is Bash?</p>
        <p class="article-content">
            Many argue that Python is a better language to learn programming,
            and I would concur completely...except for the simple fact that Bash
            is already installed on most systems, and remains the main shell
            utilized by all Linux/BSD distributions (and MacOS's zsh is close
            enough when it comes to the command line itself). This isn't to say
            that one should just learn Bash. While a fine scripting language, it
            can only accomplish so much and eventually you'll want to learn at
            least some Python, if not JavaScript and some C. Learning the
            command line (and subsequently, bash) is simply a pre-requisite
            (whether you like it or not, if you work with computers, at some
            point you will interface with it, and thusly should become at least
            somewhat familiar with it).
