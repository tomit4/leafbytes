        <h4 class="article-header4">A Summary Of Rethinking PID 1</h4>
        <p class="article-content">
On April 30th, 2010, Lennart Poettering published a blog post titled "Rethinking
PID 1" in which he gives a general overview of his offering to the init
ecosystem, systemd. In this blog post, he introduces the reader to the various
implementations that Lennart believed were an issue with the init system that had
been predominant within the Linux world at the time, sysv-init.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
His initial arguments include the need to start less processes at boot, and to
start what processes are needed in parallel. He elaborates on this argument by
pointing out the technical advantages of starting processes such as socket
services, bus services, and file system jobs all in parallel.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
He moves on to the subject of the need to "Keep PID1 small," where he argues
that the initialization of sysv-init is currently slow due to its heavy
implementation and use shell scripts, which when used as he
described them are indeed memory intensive. He then moves onto how systemd
utilizes Cgroups for process supervision and management, which he argues is
more effective for the task than simply monitoring the status of process
identifiers (PIDS).
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
He briefly mentions systemd's use of setting resource limits and how to further use
Cgroups and CPU and IO scheduler controls for security enforcement, and briefly
mentioning their implementation of logging as apart from the traditional syslog
and kmesg.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
Lennart continues onto why he found Canonical's init contribution, Upstart, as
a marked improvement over sysv-init, but ultimately still dissatisfactory.
While he admits that Upstart solves many of the issues he also had with
sysv-init, including parallelization of processes, Poettering ultimately finds
the major flaw with Upstart has to do with the way it deals with the way it
handles dependencies. He points out that Upstart is not ideal in design because
it starts all processes that might be necessary for that process
to rely on. He argues that this should be the other way around, that these
dependency processes should only start upon user initialization, not by the init
system. He does concede that some of his criticisms of Upstart were currently
being addressed at the time, but his general indication is that this was a design
problem that sits at the base of Upstart, which, as he writes towards the end in
his conclusion, is why he decided to start systemd from the ground up rather
than simply add onto Upstart's codebase.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
In a lengthy list following these criticisms of Upstart, Lennart briefly covers
the basics of how systemd's Unit files work, as well as a more technical
investigation on how systemd integrates with the previous init interfaces
occupied by sysv-init (/proc, /sys, and /dev).
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
Finally, Lennart concludes the article by writing about his future plans for
systemd.  Overall, Rethinking PID 1 is a fairly straight-forward technical summary of systemd
itself and Lennart's reasoning behind creating it. In the coming years, however, the
systemd project would expand out to a suite of tools that addressed a multitude
of needs, and it became apparent that systemd was always intended to be more
than just an init system.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
Indeed, Lennart would say systemd was not a minimalist project(especially when
compared with Upstart.), and not just an init system. This multifaceted approach
to systemd flew in the face of the UNIX philosophy, a principle upheld within
the Linux community of the time as akin to a religious mantra. The UNIX
philosophy is often pointed to meaning that a piece of software should do only one
thing, and do it well. Lennart's implementation of systemd was more akin to a Swiss
army knife than a single sharpened blade, and many still question this choice,
pointing to how systemd's large code base and ever expanding feature set
is an indication of being prone to bugs and security holes. Proponents, however,
point out that these features are a boon to system administrators, giving
them a set of tools under one project's repertoire, rather than being cobbled
together by a series of unrelated tools.
        </p>
        <h4 class="article-header4">On The Biggest Myths</h4>
        <p class="article-content">
Whenever a major change in paradigm occurs within any ecosystem, the inevitable
turbulence that said change engages will ultimately leave some within that
ecosystem at a loss. When the changeover from sysv-init was being heralded by
both Canonical and Red Hat, there were those within the Linux world that claimed
that both Upstart and systemd, respectively, were trying to fix something that
wasn't broken, colloquially known as "reinventing the wheel". As the debate
surrounding the changeover escalated, there would be those that perceived this
paradigm shift as a corporate takeover of the Linux ecosystem, with Canonical
and Red Hat at the helm of converting Linux over to an environment
more alike to the corporate infrastructures of Microsoft or Apple.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
Ultimately, however, it was becoming more and more apparent that SysV-init was
showing its age, and a more modern implementation to init would have to come sooner
rather than later. The question became not whether Linux distributions would continue
to support and maintain SysV-init, but rather the question presented to many
distribution developers/maintainers was whether or not Upstart or systemd would
eventually be adopted.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
In May of 2011, Fedora Linux, the upstream source for Red Hat Linux, would be
the first Linux distribution to enable systemd by default, replacing Upstart.
The developers would point to systemd's parallelization features, service management,
and powerful transactional dependency-based service control logic. That same month,
Mageia Linux would follow suit, with its parent distribution, Mandriva, replacing
SysVinit with systemd a few months later in August. Other distributions like Gentoo
Linux would offer systemd as an option, but included OpenRc init as an alternative.
openSUSE Linux would also offer systemd as an alternative, while still offering support
for SysVinit. Slackware Linux, one of the oldest distributions, notably declined to adopt
systemd and remained using SysVinit.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
In October 2012, the rolling release distribution, Arch Linux, switched their
default init system from SystemVinit to systemd. They cited that maintenance of
SysVinit would not be worth the effort in patches, while systemd was deemed to
be overall faster than its predecessor. By this time, the debate surrounding
systemd and its founder had gained momentum, as can be seen from these
exchanges on Arch's public forum
(https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=147272). The debate surrounding
systemd's adoption involved its implementation of Unit files over bash scripts, it
being much bigger and more extensive than SysVInit, its integration with dbus,
udev, and replacing consolekit with logind.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
As pushback against systemd began to escalate, in January of 2013, Lennart Poettering would
address his detractors in an article on his blog. Titled, "The Biggest Myths",
Lennart would attempt to counter many of The Linux communities criticisms of
systemd. Some of these criticisms he would address included titles such as: "systemd is
a monolith," "systemd is incompatible with shell scripts," "systemd is not modular,"
"systemd is not UNIX," "systemd is bloated," "systemd being Linux-only is not nice
to the BSDs," "systemd is unstable and buggy," and "systemd being Linux-only
makes it impossible for Debian to adopt it as default."
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
For those who are not familiar with the intricacies of the Linux ecosystem, this
point regarding Debian is of particular interest when talking about systemd, as
Debian is one of the oldest Linux distributions with one the largest user bases.
Debian at this point in time was well known for its stability, and was utilized
on many servers around the world. At the time, Debian was at an interesting inflection
point in the Linux ecosystem when it came to the init system, as Canonical's Ubuntu was
a fork of the Debian distribution, and Canonical had been actively pursuing their init system,
Upstart, to be adopted by Debian. Notably, Upstart developer, Steven
Langasek, was on the Debian Technical Committee at that time. Additionally,
Debian also offered a non-Linux version of their distribution known as GNU/kFreeBSD.
Lennart Poettering had made a point early on in his promotion of systemd that he would not be
offering support for any of the BSDs, as his implementation of Cgroups in systemd could not be
implemented on BSD. He would also argue that the BSDs were not interested in adopting systemd,
pointing out that their implementation of init had always been different from Linux. While true,
this indeed did throw a wrench into Debian's adoption of systemd, as Debian had
continually strived to provide as much compatibility of their distribution
between both Linux and BSD.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
In August of 2013, Lennart Poettering attended the Debian Conference in
Switzerland. Here he would give a presentation titled, "Why Debian should(or should not)
make systemd the default". Many of the same arguments Poettering would make in his initial 2010
blog post, "Rethinking PID 1," were repeated here. While Lennart does his best to
address his detractors, his lack of social graces is apparent, and at one point
he calls aspects of the Upstart team's implementation of init "chicken shit" to
their faces(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXHCeWiQz9E).
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
These kinds of interactions are, perhaps unfortunately, common amongst software developers,
especially those with competing pieces of software. And this conference occurred just
months before the Debian Technical Committee would engage in an extensive email
exchange debating whether or not to adopt systemd for their upcoming release,
Debian Jessie.
        </p>
        <h4 class="article-header4">On The Biggest Fallacies</h4>
        <p class="article-content">
On October 25, 2013, Debian Developer Paul Tagliamonte called on the Debian
Technical Committee to start discussions and come to a decision on which init
system Debian would implement for their 2015 Version 8 release. Debian
releases new versions of their distribution over a multiple year cycles and
thusly major changes to the distribution are often discussed many years in
advance. The changing of init systems was a heated debate amongst the Debian
team, and is evidenced by the multi-month email exchange that followed,
concluding on February 11, 2014.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
I think it is safe to state that this email exchange did not leave all satisfied
as to the result. After months of debate, the Debian Technical Committee came to
the conclusion that systemd would become the default init system going forward
and that support for other init systems would be supported, but not
indefinitely. Eight months after the Debian Technical Committee made
this decision, Ubuntu abandoned its own Upstart init system in favor of systemd.
A new fork of the Debian distribution, Devuan was founded, keeping the original
SysV-init as its default, eventually offering up OpenRC and runit as
alternatives. The Gentoo developers would continue to offer both systemd and
OpenRc as their init systems, with the user deciding which init to implement
upon installation. A similar project, Artix Linux would fork from Arch Linux
in 2017, five years after Arch Linux had officially adopted systemd
as its sole init system. Artix Linux currently offers runit, s6, dinit, and
OpenRc as alternatives to systemd. Slackware continues to offer SysV-init as its
default init system. According to truelist.co, roughly 500 Linux distributions
are under active development as of April of 2022, with less than 10% of those
Linux Distributions not utilizing systemd according to my own estimates from
Wikipedia's list of non-systemd
distributions(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_distributions_without_systemd).
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
So if systemd won the init wars, why are there still distributions that to this
day refuse to use it? In the case of Artix and Devuan Linux, these distributions
are pretty much defined by their defiance to utilizing systemd as an init
system. Truthfully, the reasons range from simple dislike of the systemd founders, to
somewhat technical arguments centered around systemd's feature creep. The latter
of these arguments are what I personally find more intriguing, although I'll
admit that I personally find Lennart Poettering and Kay Siever's social graces left
for wanting.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
After Debian's adoption of systemd, many within the Linux ecosystem saw that the
init wars was indeed over. The choice by the Debian Technical Committee to adopt
systemd was the nail in the coffin of Upstart, and other init systems were all
but forgotten except amongst the distributions who adamantly opposed its mass
adoption.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
The years that followed systemd's mass adoption came with many detractors
initially, as many bugs and security flaws were found during these early years.
In September of 2015, Jude C. Nelson, Distributed Systems PhD student at
Princeton University, wrote an article titled "The Biggest Fallacies," which
retorted many of the common arguments made in favor of systemd's mass adoption. While this
article provides in depth technical arguments for why systemd's monolithic
design and use of binary logging was poor software design, ultimately the more
technically sound arguments can be found presented by the s6 init system's developer,
Laurent Bercot.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
In January 2015, software developer Steve Litt wrote an email regarding an
article on init systems he was writing to Laurent Bercot, developer of the s6
init system. Laurent goes into a lengthy and descriptive argument as to why
systemd's implementation of socket activation is not as beneficial as Lennart
purports it to be. Additionally, Bercot points out that the integration of cgroups
into the init system was never necessary unless the init system became so monolithic
as to constitute its use. He finally points out that while systemd aims to provide an "OS Toolkit," it
does so without providing enough modularity, making it a program that lacks
composability, which is generally frowned upon in software design. He concludes
with arguing that the complexity of systemd comes at the cost of manpower. All other
init systems have been written by a small team, or in some cases (runit, s6), by
a single individual. He argues that the manpower required to develop and
maintain systemd could have been utilized for other more worthwhile projects had
Red Hat chosen to keep their init system small and modular in design.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
These arguments, however, would go unheard. Eventually, systemd became beloved for its
features and ease of use. Writing Unit Files was praised for being easy and its
feature set was seen no longer as an example of feature creep, but rather more alike
the features of the modern day Web Browser, or the Linux kernel, monolithic by design
and necessary. Modern Linux users downplay and/or ignore the UNIX philosophy as an overly
simplistic model of software development, and to criticize systemd, or even
bring up the subject of it possibly not being the best implementation of init, is immediately
met with blind dismissal by the majority.
        </p>
        <h4 class="article-header4">Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="article-content">
It is impossible for me to cover this subject without any bias. While I did
initially utilize systemd on my home desktop computer when I first started to
use Manjaro Linux in 2020, I soon found myself installing and utilizing Artix
Linux at the beginning of 2021 after doing some research on systemd, and
determined that trying out another init system might be worthwhile. I have not
installed a different Linux distribution on my home desktop nor laptop since
then, as I have been happy using runit instead.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
I suppose the ultimate question is: was the mass adoption of systemd a good thing?
In the end? As a non-systemd user, one might think I would adamantly say, "never!"
In truth though, even after this long in depth look into the systemd debate, I can
only shrug my shoulders at this question and say "maybe?" I have only
perused the source code of systemv-init, runit, upstart, s6, launchd, and
systemd, and have not given each of them the technical screening each of them deserves
to properly answer this question.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
Ultimately, what init system one chooses to use shouldn't matter. Computers were
meant to get work done, and init's main responsibility is simply to be sure that the
computer remains running once booted. The fact is that sysv-init served that
purpose just fine. It is also a fact that init systems like runit, s6, and Openrc
addressed many of the concerns around sysv-init that existed when this debate
took place (none of them, however, had the needed amount of manpower to work on mass
integration). It appears to me that systemd also addressed these concerns,
but also expanded its features to encompass parts of the Operating System that were never
intrinsically part of init, but rather were traditionally the domains of either kernel
or user space programs.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
My personal preferences regarding software development are still coming into
their own. I have not been coding for very long and truthfully should have
probably waited until I had more expertise under my belt before commenting on
this, but I personally find the debate around systemd compelling, and wanted to
express that opinion now.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
I do currently have a preference for small modular programs that only do one
thing, and hopefully do them well, and if they do do more than one thing, it still falls within
the purview of the overall theme of the project, hopefully. The editor I work in, NeoVim, has many
features, but ultimately is solely for editing text, not browsing the internet. That said, I expect
my browser to not do just one thing well, and indeed, the modern web browser is capable of
doing nearly everything a modern Operating System can. Whether or not this is a
good thing is actually a good analogy to the systemd debate. Certain pieces of
software have a multitudinous feature set by necessity. I do believe it is no longer apt to
say that every piece of software should "do one thing well." More succinctly, I
think it is more appropriate to ask "which pieces of software should have a
large feature set, and why?" In regards to init, one might ask "should my init
system be more akin to a suite of software that does many things, or should it
solely be an init system whose sole purpose is to start, reboot, and shutdown my
OS?"
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
My final conclusion regarding all of this is that I personally do want my init
system to solely do one thing, at least by default. I see the appeal of systemd,
I really do, but I personally find that an init system should not be like
a browser or any other multi-featured piece of software, and instead to simply
do one thing well. Writing this blog post has opened my eyes to a particular
aspect of how the philosophy around software design has evolved over the years, and
I am glad I did so. I will probably always find this debate fascinating, as without the
proper implementation of PID 1, it wouldn't matter how good any Operating System kernel was
developed, it simply wouldn't run.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
I do understand why most within the Linux community no longer wish to look
into the topic. Ultimately init is meant simply to run in the background, do
its job, and be forgotten about. Only when PID 1 fails to launch or has a security
breach do most users care to investigate. I feel it is apt to point out that in
all likelihood, systemd won't forever be the predominant init system on Linux. Much
like sysv-init, one day, systemd will show its age, and be replaced by a piece of software
that fits more in lines of the needs of the future. Perhaps then we'll look back at the more
simple solutions, and once again, take closer look at what's init.
