            Hello and Welcome, Traveler!
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            This being my first blog post ever, I suppose it is best to do a brief introduction into who I
            am and what this is all about. My name is Brian Hayes, I am 39 years old, and am currently in
            the process of slowly but surely learning more and more about the world of Computers and
            Computer Science, with a focus on web development and software development with the goal of
            making a career change as a Web Developer.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            Prior to this, I have worked as a Barista, a Teacher's Assistant, a Graphic Designer, and a
            Hotel Concierge. I have a Bachelor's of Fine Arts in Illustration from The Art Center College
            of Design in Pasadena.

            I have always been what would call a "power user" when it comes to computers, but until about
            two years ago, if you showed me a line of code, I would have scratched my head in confusion
            (I still do, albeit not as often).
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            The purpose of this blog is to document my opinion and knowledge on computer-related subjects
            that have and continue to strike my interest to this day.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            My earliest memory of interacting with a computer was when I was in the second grade, and
            seeing a green coloredMS-DOS command line open. By following the teacher's instructions, I
            recall playing very basic games on this computer but being relatively uninterested at the time.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            Prior to the internet becoming a household name, at around 11 or 12 years of age, remember my
            mother investing in a digital typewriter, which had the wonderful feature of being able to
            write text before printing it, so that one could edit one's typos without having to utilize
            white out on the page. A few years later the desktop computer would become a necessity in the
            home, as the internet had finally arrived on the worldwide scene, and changed everything.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            I quickly became enthralled with the user friendliness of Windows (at this time I believe it
            was Windows 95). I was heavily active in the early days of internet. I was an avid user of
            AIM, ICQ, Yahoo, and played text-based role-playing games known as MUDs.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            Eventually video games would take over the focus of my youth, as JRPGs became a passion of
            mine that lasted nearly a decade, and certainly consumed my high school years.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            When I arrived at college, computers played a pivotal role as my major was Illustration (and
            Animation prior to that). I went to college during an interesting period of change for the
            academic institutions, as they had only half-way evolved and embraced computer technology.
            As an Illustration Major, I spent more time mixing paint and copying Renaissance Drawings than
            I did studying Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator (software which, while greatly improved
            currently, I still have issues with when compared with traditional mediums). That said, I
            became familiar with the basics of Photoshop (and a bit of Illustrator) which served my needs
            for making personal work.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            When I graduated from college, I had little direction about where to go next. All I knew was
            that I needed to make money and I did what so many in the creative fields did, I went to work
            at a cafe, specifically Starbucks. The majority of my life has been working low level minimum
            wage jobs that have been rewarding in many respects, and many would say I had wasted my time
            learning thte arts because of this lack of money, but I honestly will never regret it. The
            skills I have are very valuable to me and if I could do it all over again, knowing what I know
            now, I still would not change a single moment of it.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            Reality does eventually come knocking, however, and I guess that moment came two years ago
            when I realized I was never going to make much money in my life. I was approaching the end of
            my thirties, and had gained a great variety of knowledge in various other fields. I had, at
            this point, built and rode a fixed gear bicycle throughout the steep hills of Los Angeles and
            its adjacent cities for four years, studied and adhered to a strict Vegan diet (prior to the
            food shelves being flooded with options), read over seventy books on the history of boxing,
            and had played a niche sport called American Handball for a bit over eight years. Everything I
            had done I had approached with an obsessive, single minded focus where everything else was
            thrown aside (except for my day jobs). Romantic Relationships and even Friendships were all
            but ignored in order to accomplish some ineffible goal. A goal without an end in sight...a
            goal that always ended the same way; impovershed, skilled at a so many things that society
            had deemed interesting, but not lucrativie, and therefore, ultimately, only worthwhile as
            an aside, and not a feature, of everyday life.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            I consider myself to be the luckiest man alive, considering all of this. I had by chance met,
            and eventually became best friends with a man in college whose name I shall omit here.
            Sufficient to say, I would not be who I am today without his influence. He helped me learn how
            to draw, how to drive (in Los Angeles), how to calm my mind, and so many other things. I lived
            with him for eighteen years in Los Angeles, and he enabled me to live a life of indulgence in
            whatever I fancied at the time because he had kept my rent extremely low. I was also
            exceptionally lucky in that my parents and grandparents had covered the entirety of my
            college expenses, so I had no student debt to speak of when I graduated. Like I said, luckest
            man alive.

            Eighteen years of making art, cycling, reading and studying, taking up the sport of
            handball... I have loved many different aspects of life. Everything changes, and nothing lasts
            forever. Two years ago, I was working as a concierge for a hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. It
            was about as good a job as I had ever had. I eventually became their full time night auditor,
            which gave me the time to focus on yet another obsession, and I decided it was time to study
            something that I knew would probably take the rest of my life and I expect it to. I decided,
            after literally years of debate, to try my hand at learning how to code, and by extension,
            learn everything I could about Computers.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            When I say this decision took years just to make, I mean it. I was avidly involved in the
            Handball community at this time. Coaching, refereeing, playing two to three times a week and
            training both physically and mentally for it. I had never played sports as a kid, and so my
            aim to become as good as I could would probably never end. The choice to walk away and study
            coding was a hard one. I knew I only studiied one thing at a time and that this wouuld be no
            different. I had been dedicated to the sport of Handball for eight years, but it, like art,
            was a love that would never become a profession.

            My best friend and long term roommate at the time had at this point been a professional, self
            taught, JavaScript developer for four years. He had taught himself how to code, made
            professional contacts within the field of software development, and had landed a lucrative six
            figure a year paying job. I had personally benefited from this choice, as without it, it is
            unlikely he could have continued to afford to pay the mortgage on the house he had bought,
            and in which I had rented the studio basement. After he landed this job, he had encouraged me
            to start to learn JavaScript as well. He handed me the book Eloquent JavaScript, by Marijn
            Haverbeke, and after working through about four chapters of exercises, decided it wasn't for
            me. I got easily frustrated at not understanding the syntax, and decided to simply continue
            pursuing my beloved sport.

            Roughly four years later, with my Night Audit Job secure, I decided it was time to give it
            another chance. I gave up Handball, and began devoting all my waking hours to either learning
            how to code, learning about Linux, or doing the menial tasks at my job.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            I am still in the midst of this journey. Perhaps obviously, I am looking to acquire a Junior
            Web Developer posititon, a career change that many are attempting to go through at this time.
            I have since quit my Night Auditor position and moved back in with my parents in Battle Ground,
            Washington due to life decisions/changes. I am foregoing getting a new job at this time and am
            focusing completely on learning computers and programming in the hopes of acquiring a job in
            the field and devoting the majority of my life to learning as much as I can about the subject
            of Computer Science (without necessarily going back to school for it). This is all, obviously,
            a gigantic gamble I am taking on myself and on the world still needing good software developers
            going forward into the future.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content">
            Nevertheless, it is, for me, another obsession, another love, another chapter in my life. I
            doubt I'll ever be more than a mediocre programmer a best, considering how late in life I
            have come to study it. I am still, very much, a beginner at all of this. This blog is meant
            to document, at least in some small part, my attempts to wade through the vast subjects of
            Web Development, Computers, and Computer Science. I invite anyone interested in my meanderings
            to follow along. Welcome Traveler!
